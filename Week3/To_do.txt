To Do::

7.1.4:
	#1# Modify the script TreeHeight.R to do the following:
		a~ Loads trees.csv and calculates tree heights for all trees in the data. Distances = meters.
		
		b~ Creates a csv output called TreeHts.csv in Results that contains the calculated tree heights w/ original data in the following format:  "Species // Distance.m // Angle.degrees // Tree.height.m//." Work via source or Rscript.


	#2# Make the TreeHeight.R script more general so that it could be used for other datasets:
		
		a~ Write another script called get_TreeHeight.R that takes a csv file name from command line (e.g. get_TreeHeight.R Trees.csv) and outputs the result to a file just like TreeHeight.R above, but this time included the input file name in the output file name as InputFileName_treeheights.csv. Note that you will have to strip the .csv. ## Hint: Command-line parameters are accessible within the R running env via commandArgs() so help(commandArgs) may be a starting point

		b~ Write a unix shell script called run_get_TreeHeight.sh that tests get_TreeHeight.R - include trees.csv as example file. Note that source will not work in this case as it does not allow scripts with arguments to be run: Use Rscript!!!!

	#EC~1# Write a python version of get_TreeHeight.R (get_TreeHeight.py). Include test of this script into run_get_TreeHeight.sh.


=#=#=#=#=#=#=#

8.3.1:

	#1# Complete Vectorize 2 Practical according to speed.
	#EC# Impelement python versions of Vect1 and Vect2. Then write a bash script that compares speed of all 4 scripts.


8.8.1:
	1. Autocorrelation in weather
	
	a) Make a new script called TAutoCorr.R in Code
	b) Load & Examines and Plots KeyWestAnnual.....re.Rdata using (load)
	c) Hypths: Is the temperature of one year significantly correlated with the next year, across the years. That is calculate the correlation between n - 1 pairs of years, where n is the total number of years. However, canno tuse standard p-value calculated for a correlation coerficient using R's cor() function because measurements of climatic vars in succ time-points in time series. Successive secs, mins, hours and NOT INDPENDANT.
	
	HENCE
		~ Compute the appro. corr. coeff. b/w successive years and store it
		~ Perform calculation 10000 times by:
			# randomly permuting the time series (use sample function)
		~ The computing the corr coeff for each randomly permuated year seq nd storing it.

T	d) Then calc what fraction of the corr coeffs from step 2 were greater than that from step 1 (this is your appx. p-value)

	e) How do you interpret? why? present in a pdf written in LaTeX document (inc. source code).

	
	EC:
	Mapping with maps package

	a) use load from GPDDFiltered.RData
	Need lat & long info for a bunch of species for which pop time series are available.

	use ggplot2: create a script that
			1) Loads maps
			2) loads GPDD
			3) Creates a world map
			4) Superimposes on the map all the locations from which we have data in the GPDD dataframe
			5) What biases might you expect in any analysis on data? Include answer in comment at end of R script.

Review and make sure you can run all the commands, code fragments, and named scripts
we have built till now and get the expected outputs.
2. Annotate/comment your code lines as much and as often as necessary using #.
3. Keep all code, data and results files organized in the Week3/ directory
git add, commit and push all your code and data from this chapter to your git repository by
Wednesday, Nov 2, 5PM.
