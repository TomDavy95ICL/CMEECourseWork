On Neutral Theory in Ecology:: (Hubble, 2001)
	=/= "Null Model"
	=/= Assuming indifference between species
	=== Demographic properties of individual are independent of species identity, i.e. birth/death processes, migration
	=== 


Example:
	Voter Model (Holley & Liggett 1975)
	
		> Pick a Random Neighbour
		> You take their view OR v.v
		> Keep going for a while; see what happens (in practice)
			> Fixation


[!] Model Rules

	Infinite spatial birth/death neutral model w/ mutation parametre

	|> Variations
		:: Zero Sum - Death need not preclude birth. =/=d(Outcome), d(Methods).
		:: Speciation Modes - None, 
				      Point Mutation, 
				      Random Fission a la allopatric speciation
				      Protracted Speciation, over long time
		
		:: Spatial Structuring
					Implicit - Local, Meta community.
					Spatially explicit network w/ migration, edge effects. i.e. archipelago
					Fully Spatically explicit - Distribution of dispersal as funciton of distance from origin;
	Hubble = Zero Sum, Speciation, 


Applications:
	
	Comprehension & Prediction

		[!] Species abundance distributions - Will be running neutral model of this
			
			--> Ricklefs 2003 "Mean species lifetimes are too short"
			 --> Temporal / Protracted evo model solves this.

	1:1 modelling not appropriate : be selective

MacArthur & Wilson 1967 Theory of Biogeography.
	Immigration/Extinction model of island species richness
		Tends to dynamic equilibrium
